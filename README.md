# LockerLine

A bank of 48 parcel lockers in an apartment block: couriers drop, residents collect with a code that expires.

## How pickup codes are stored

A code has only a million possible values, so a plain hash of a leaked table is reversed in seconds. Codes are stored
as HMAC-SHA-256 with `code-hash-key` (a setting, never in the database): without the key the stored hashes are
useless. Because the hash is keyed but has no per-row salt, a presented code is found with one equality lookup
(bcrypt would mean checking the code against every waiting parcel), and the final comparison is constant-time.
